if you have already opened your terminal then clone this repo with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Exhembeast/API.git

this step should install almost all the folders needed and will be like this:

now all the folders needed and node modules are all ready to run!

to run the API make sure to type in your terminal: npm run start
other option its typing: nodemon src/index.js

It must look like this:
